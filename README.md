## Section 1: General Ethics

1. The entry entitled "African Ethics" begins by distinguishing morality and ethics, and in doing so gives a good general definition of ethics.

   >The term ‘ethics’ is technically used by philosophers to mean a philosophical study of morality—morality understood as a set of social rules, principles, norms that guide or are intended to guide the conduct of people in a society, and as beliefs about right and wrong conduct as well as good or bad character. 

   A few of the most striking entries returned from a search for "ethics" include "Search Engines and Ethics," an exploration of the ethical problems with internet search engines. "Human Enhancement,"  an entry that explores the ethical implications of "human enhancement," giving examples such as "physical fitness routines, wearing eyeglasses, taking music lessons and prayer." And "Human/Non-Human Chimeras," an entry on the ethical implications of genetically modifying humans to include non-human DNA.
   
2. Aristotle lays the burden of responsibility for behaving ethically upon each individual, arguing that each individual is responsible for behaving in an ethical manner. He also argues that politics is the practice of creating a society in which individuals can live a good and ethical life.

## Section 2: Applied Ethics

1. If all people were ethical in their actions, corruption would no longer exist in modern society. Corruption exists in public and private organizations as a result of individuals in positions of power who abuse their authority for their own monetary or political gain, generally to the detriment of others. The conduct of these individuals is plainly unethical. In a utilitarian sense, it does the most good for one or few people and, in the worst cases, causes harm to almost everyone else within society. If everyone in a postition of power were to behave ethically, corruption would no longer exist within any organization because these individuals would consider the good of everyone to be more pertinent than the good of themselves.
2. The most obvious recent example of the interests of the group being placed before those of the individual would be in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In many cases individuals have been forced out of work and prevented from taking part in physical social interactions. All of this is in the name of protecting public health and the ability of the group to manage the often dire consequences of this disease with limited resources.

   To embed balance between the freedom and wellbeing of an individual with the common welfare, an ethical code might include a statement like, "The rights and privileges granted to individuals cannot be infringed unless they conflict with the ability of others to enjoy those same rights and privileges." Applying this specifically to the pandemic response, allowing individuals within society to function as usual would hugely increase the rates of infection, which would in turn lead to worse outcomes for society as a whole, including much greater loss of human life. Society as a whole would bear these unecessary losses and individuals at greater risk would have their right to be safe and healthy infringed by the actions of others.

## Section 3: Current Ethics Examples

1. The article from Nature identified ethical conflicts that have arisen from studies conducted at disaster sites. The article described a few examples of disasters that occurred around the world and the imbalance created by the fact that in many countries, the studies written about disasters are predominantly from nations external to the location of the disaster site. The ethical dilemma comes from the fact that these studies have yielded results which help to create better early warning systems, but predominantly foreign researchers may not take into account the cultures and needs of the victims of such disasters. It is unclear how to behave most ethically in a situation where lives can be saved by research, but most of the money available to conduct such research is located in a foreign country whose researchers may not always act in the best interests of locals.
2. Ethical Issues Created by the Pandemic:
   1. Much of the population of recovering addicts relies on social contact and the forging of strong social and community bonds in order to recover from addiction. Additionally, most recovery fellowships have traditions revolving around service to the community as a way to remain connected and prevent relapse. Much like COVID-19, addiction is a deadly disease which claims many thousands of lives. The dilemma here is that, while the fellowships have continued to operate online, the pandemic response has weakened the ability of these groups to connect with people who are newly sober or still in active addiction. Thus, it is likely that more lives will be claimed and more suffering will be caused by addiction as a result of the pandemic response.
   2. Many people classified as "essential workers" rely on their income to survive and support themselves and their families. However, in the United States a vast portion of these people lack benefits including paid sick leave. Therefore, if one of these people does become ill, they are faced with a dilemma about whether to take time off work and risk their financial security or to go to work while sick and risk infecting large numbers of people.
   3. Patients with COVID-19 are highly infectious, and when hospitalized they must be quarantined. This means that a subset of these people are not able to have direct physical contact with friends or family before they die from the disease. The normal grieving process for families may be inhibited by a lack of contact during the death of their loved one. Additionally, for various reasons normal ceremonies such as viewings and funerals are not currently possible, which further inhibits grieving. It is also probable that isolation from loved ones reduces the rate of recovery, as mental health plays a role in recovery from any illness. All of these factors conflict with the desire of healthcare professionals to reduce the rate of infection, which is currently the only way to prevent further suffering from the illness.
