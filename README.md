## Section 1: General Ethics

1. The entry entitled "African Ethics" begins by distinguishing morality and ethics, and in doing so gives a good general definition of ethics.
>The term ‘ethics’ is technically used by philosophers to mean a philosophical study of morality—morality understood as a set of social rules, principles, norms that guide or are intended to guide the conduct of people in a society, and as beliefs about right and wrong conduct as well as good or bad character. 

   A few of the most striking entries returned from a search for "ethics" include "Search Engines and Ethics," an exploration of the ethical problems with internet search engines. "Human Enhancement,"  an entry that explores the ethical implications of "human enhancement," giving examples such as "physical fitness routines, wearing eyeglasses, taking music lessons and prayer." And "Human/Non-Human Chimeras," an entry on the ethical implications of genetically modifying humans to include non-human DNA. haracter. It is a disposition, well entrenched in its possessor—something that, as we say, goes all the way down, unlike a habit such as being a tea-drinker—to notice, expect, value, feel, desire, choose, act, and react in certain characteristic ways. To possess a virtue is to be a certain sort of person with a certain complex min
   
2. Aristotle lays the burden of responsibility for behaving ethically upon each individual, arguing that each individual is responsible for behaving in an ethical manner. He also argues that politics is the practice of creating a society in which individuals can live a good life.

## Section 2: Applied Ethics

1. If all people were ethical in their actions, corruption would no longer exist in modern society. Corruption exists in public and private organizations as a result of individuals in positions of power who abuse their authority for their own monetary or political gain, generally to the detriment of others. The conduct of these individuals is plainly unethical. In a utilitarian sense, it does the most good for one or few people and, in the worst cases, causes harm to almost everyone else within society. If everyone in a postition of power were to behave ethically, corruption would no longer exist within any organization because these individuals would consider the good of everyone to be more pertinent than the good of themselves.
2. The most obvious recent example of the interests of the group being placed before those of the individual would be in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In many cases individuals have been forced out of work and prevented from taking part in physical social interactions. All of this is in the name of protecting public health and the ability of the group to manage the often dire consequences of this disease with limited resources. To embed balance between the freedom and wellbeing of an individual with the common welfare, an ethical code might include a statement like, "The rights and privileges granted to individuals cannot be infringed unless they conflict with the ability of others to enjoy those same rights and privileges." Applying this specifically to the pandemic response, allowing individuals within society to function as usual would hugely increase the rates of infection, which would in turn lead to worse outcomes for society as a whole, including much greater loss of human life. Society as a whole would bear these unecessary losses and individuals at greater risk would have their right to be safe and healthy infringed by the actions of others.
