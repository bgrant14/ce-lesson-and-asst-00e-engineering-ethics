## Section 1: General Ethics

1. The entry entitled "African Ethics" begins by distinguishing morality and ethics, and in doing so gives a good general definition of ethics.

   >The term ‘ethics’ is technically used by philosophers to mean a philosophical study of morality—morality understood as a set of social rules, principles, norms that guide or are intended to guide the conduct of people in a society, and as beliefs about right and wrong conduct as well as good or bad character. 

   A few of the most striking entries returned from a search for "ethics" include "Search Engines and Ethics," an exploration of the ethical problems with internet search engines. "Human Enhancement,"  an entry that explores the ethical implications of "human enhancement," giving examples such as "physical fitness routines, wearing eyeglasses, taking music lessons and prayer." And "Human/Non-Human Chimeras," an entry on the ethical implications of genetically modifying humans to include non-human DNA.
   
2. Aristotle lays the burden of responsibility for behaving ethically upon each individual, arguing that each individual is responsible for behaving in an ethical manner. He also argues that politics is the practice of creating a society in which individuals can live a good and ethical life.

## Section 2: Applied Ethics

1. If all people were ethical in their actions, corruption would no longer exist in modern society. Corruption exists in public and private organizations as a result of individuals in positions of power who abuse their authority for their own monetary or political gain, generally to the detriment of others. The conduct of these individuals is plainly unethical. In a utilitarian sense, it does the most good for one or few people and, in the worst cases, causes harm to almost everyone else within society. If everyone in a postition of power were to behave ethically, corruption would no longer exist within any organization because these individuals would consider the good of everyone to be more pertinent than the good of themselves.

2. The most obvious recent example of the interests of the group being placed before those of the individual would be in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In many cases individuals have been forced out of work and prevented from taking part in physical social interactions. All of this is in the name of protecting public health and the ability of the group to manage the often dire consequences of this disease with limited resources.

   To embed balance between the freedom and wellbeing of an individual with the common welfare, an ethical code might include a statement like, "The rights and privileges granted to individuals cannot be infringed unless they conflict with the ability of others to enjoy those same rights and privileges." Applying this specifically to the pandemic response, allowing individuals within society to function as usual would hugely increase the rates of infection, which would in turn lead to worse outcomes for society as a whole, including much greater loss of human life. Society as a whole would bear these unecessary losses and individuals at greater risk would have their right to be safe and healthy infringed by the actions of others.

## Section 3: Current Ethics Examples

1. The article from Nature identified ethical conflicts that have arisen from studies conducted at disaster sites. The article described a few examples of disasters that occurred around the world and the imbalance created by the fact that in many countries, the studies written about disasters are predominantly from nations external to the location of the disaster site. The ethical dilemma comes from the fact that these studies have yielded results which help to create better early warning systems, but predominantly foreign researchers may not take into account the cultures and needs of the victims of such disasters. It is unclear how to behave most ethically in a situation where lives can be saved by research, but most of the money available to conduct such research is located in a foreign country whose researchers may not always act in the best interests of locals.

2. Ethical Issues Created by the Pandemic:

   1. Much of the population of recovering addicts relies on social contact and the forging of strong social and community bonds in order to recover from addiction. Additionally, most recovery fellowships have traditions revolving around service to the community as a way to remain connected and prevent relapse. Much like COVID-19, addiction is a deadly disease which claims many thousands of lives. The dilemma here is that, while the fellowships have continued to operate online, the pandemic response has weakened the ability of these groups to connect with people who are newly sober or still in active addiction. Thus, it is likely that more lives will be claimed and more suffering will be caused by addiction as a result of the pandemic response.
   
   2. Many people classified as "essential workers" rely on their income to survive and support themselves and their families. However, in the United States a vast portion of these people lack benefits including paid sick leave. Therefore, if one of these people does become ill, they are faced with a dilemma about whether to take time off work and risk their financial security or to go to work while sick and risk infecting large numbers of people.
   
   3. Patients with COVID-19 are highly infectious, and when hospitalized they must be quarantined. This means that a subset of these people are not able to have direct physical contact with friends or family before they die from the disease. The normal grieving process for families may be inhibited by a lack of contact during the death of their loved one. Additionally, for various reasons normal ceremonies such as viewings and funerals are not currently possible, which further inhibits grieving. It is also probable that isolation from loved ones reduces the rate of recovery, as mental health plays a role in recovery from any illness. All of these factors conflict with the desire of healthcare professionals to reduce the rate of infection, as physical isolation is currently the only way to prevent further suffering from the illness. 

## Section 4: Engineering Ethics

1. The ACM's code of conduct asserts an idea that I associate with engineering in general, that it is ideally about creating and utilizing technologies that make life easier and better for humanity.

   The code's take on unauthorized access to computer systems is novel and interesting to me. It argues that a computing professional may attain unauthorized access to a system under certain circumstances. This makes sense in context, as the code explains that this can only be done ethically if the system in question is being used for malicious purposes.
2. The Microsoft open-source code of conduct addresses how the open source community should behave and interact. It is targetted at anyone participating in Microsoft-managed open source communities. The most important element of ethical behavior according to this code is creating a community that is accessible and safe for everyone. The Microsoft managed OSS we have been using for this course is GitHub.

3. The main ethical aspect that the Royal Society article hints at is that data is the primary source of ethical quandaries with regard to computer technologies, and therefore ought to be the focus of ethical guidelines.

4. The conference needs a code of conduct to govern how people interact with each other to ensure that everyone feels welcome and able to participate. 

5. Google appears to be concerned with the potential for AI systems to be used for unethical purposes which cause harm to people or infringe on their rights. The responsibility they are talking about relates to the potential for such technologies to be applied in a way that is harmful, and the ethical imperative that they are applied only for purposes that are beneficial.

6. As discussed throughout this report, ethics are a framework for determining the right way to behave in a given situation. Hacking, as it is commonly understood, involves the unauthorized or unethical use of computer systems for criminal activities, such as extortion. Ethical hacking is a practice which uses the mindset and tools of a criminal hacker for positive and socially responsible purposes. A common example of ethical hacking would be penetration testing, which is the practice of attempting to break into a system (with the permission of its owner) in order to identify and fix security vulnerabilites.

## Section 5: Codes of Conduct

1. A version of the prisoner's dilemma can be observed with regard to adhering to an ethical code in that there may be certain advantages to gain if one party does not adhere. This party can maintain its advantage as long as it is the only one with that is not adhering to the code. However, if neither party adheres to the code then neither party has an advantage and the code of ethics has, in practice, become irrelevant.

   One strategy to maintain adherance to an ethical code would be to thoroughly explain the reasoning behind the code of conduct. If there is general agreement upon the principles behind the ethical code, then most people will adhere to the code to the best of their abilities. However, there are certain people who will will not be persuaded to behave ethically by principled arguments, for that reason it may be necessary to employ other strategies enforce or encourage adherence. An example of a punitive element of an ethical code would be to encourage whistleblowing to "call out" some entity that is acting unethically so that their reputation is damaged. Conversely, positive reinforcement can be built in by identifying entities that hold themselves to high ethical standards so that others can emulate them.
   
2. Tech Startup Thought Experiment

   1. My technical innovation would be to use networks of drones equipped with imaging devices to continuously monitor high-density urban areas in order to give real-time foot traffic analyses and predictions.
   
   2. The societal benefits of this innovation include intelligent routing of individuals to avoid traffic, much like modern GPS navigation can do for automotive travel. This would be of particular use during a disease outbreak, as the foot traffic in open public spaces is not currently able to be closely monitored and limited in the same way that foot traffic within places like grocery stores can be. During periods when it is appropriate to have mass gatherings in public, it would still be useful for planning a walking route that avoids high-traffic areas or for citizens or tourists seeking to find ongoing public events.
   
      1. One of the most obvious abuses of this technology would be its use as a convenient mass surveilance tool. With facial recognition and a machine-learning system, it would become trivial for law enforcement agencies or corporations to track individuals in public places. This could be mitigated with the use of strong encryption for any data sent to or from a drone and an algorithm wherever the data is being harvested to remove identifying features from people (e.g. by blurring faces).
      
         This technology could also be used by criminals to plan crimes like robbery or assault as, if the system was displaying up-to-the-minute data, they could stalk and corner a victim and be sure that no one else was close enough to intervene. One way to mitigate this probability would be to time-delay the data by 5 minutes or so, which would make it more difficult to plan criminal activities but still provide useful information for non-criminals. Another solution would be prevent the system from reporting the locations of individuals or small groups, eg. only show the data if there are more than 5 people, each standing within 2 meters of each other.
         
         Another potential issue would be keeping drones from falling out of the sky, potentially causing injury or damaging property. This could be mitigated with regular maintenance and strict monitoring of the status of each drone as well as current and developing weather conditions. Quad-rotor drones already have a fair bit of redundancy, however -- depending on the probability of simultaneous multiple rotor failures -- it may be necessary to use 6- or 8-rotor drones.
         
      2. Immediately upon launch, the benefit of this innovation would be that people could regulate their own access to crowded public spaces and plan according to current risks. The primary detriment might be a public perception that there is an "eye in the sky" and a resulting increase in certain peoples' agoraphobic tendencies.
      
         After the innovation had become an accepted part of everyday life, the benefits of substantially easier and more effective route planning for pedestrians will have been fully realized. The detriment might be an increased awareness by certain organizations that the technology has uses which violate the average citizens' right to privacy.
         
3. Ensuring that privacy is built into the core of the software would be paramount to ethically and responsibly implementing this technology. It would make sense to build whatever is technologically feasible into the drone's onboard computer in order to facilitate this, so that non-anonymized data never leaves the drone. Ensuring that respect for individual privacy is at the core of the company culture would be vitally important as well. This could be accomplished through thorough training on the topic as well as questions to vet new hires during the interview process.

4. __Code of Ethics__
   1. _Respect everyone's right to privacy._ 
   2. _Take the safety of everyone into account._ 
   3. _Consider the implications of your actions before you take them._
   4. _Be honest with yourself and others._
