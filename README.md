## Section 1: General Ethics

1. The entry entitled "African Ethics" begins by distinguishing morality and ethics, and in doing so gives a good general definition of ethics.
>The term ‘ethics’ is technically used by philosophers to mean a philosophical study of morality—morality understood as a set of social rules, principles, norms that guide or are intended to guide the conduct of people in a society, and as beliefs about right and wrong conduct as well as good or bad character. 

⋅⋅⋅A few of the most striking entries returned from a search for "ethics" include "Search Engines and Ethics," an exploration of the ethical problems with internet search engines. "Human Enhancement,"  an entry that explores the ethical implications of "human enhancement," giving examples such as "physical fitness routines, wearing eyeglasses, taking music lessons and prayer." And "Human/Non-Human Chimeras," an entry on the ethical implications of genetically modifying humans to include non-human DNA.
